# Support runbook

This document describes possible ways in which the system may fail or malfunction, with instructions how to handle and recover from these scenarios.

This runbook is supplementary to the [general 24/7 support runbook](https://intranet.torchbox.com/propositions/design-and-build-proposition/delivering-projects/dedicated-support-team/247-support-out-of-hours-runbook/), with details about project-specific actions which may be necessary for troubleshooting and restoring service.

See also our [incident process](https://intranet.torchbox.com/propositions/design-and-build-proposition/delivering-projects/application-support/incident-process/) if you're not already following this.

    **Remove the above intranet references if this project will be supported by the client's team, or handed to a third party for support. Consider whether to incorporate any scenarios from the general runbook in these cases.**
