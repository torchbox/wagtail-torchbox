                <p>Cookies are small text files of information automatically downloaded by your computer or mobile phone when you visit our site. These files are stored in your web browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer) and requested by our website when you visit us again. Most websites use cookies because, unlike you and me, websites have no memory to keep track of information, such as what pages you spend the most time on, or whether you view the site on a mobile phone or desktop computer.</p>
                <p>Still curious? Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR-xtJVq7E">Google’s video about cookies</a>. Or check out <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>

                <p>Small pieces of information can make a big difference to how we design our site for you. Imagine if data gathered by cookies showed us that 80% of Torchbox visitors look at our site on their mobile phone. Insights like that can help us focus our energy on making a better mobile version for you.</p>

            <div class="rich-text">
                <p>Our cookies come from four main sources: Google Analytics, Google Optimize, FullStory and Hotjar.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Google Analytics is widely used across the web to understand things such as which pages you arrive at, how you navigate around the site, and which kind of device you are using. To do this, Google collects individuals’ anonymised data and stitches it all together to create a big picture. All this data ultimately helps us make improvements to your experience. We feel it’s a win-win relationship. Find out more about <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Google Analytics cookies</a>.</li>
                    <li>Google Optimize is used to keep track of your involvement in website experiments. By “experiment” we’re not talking about lab coats and electrodes. In this context, an experiment could be something like an A/B split test. This is where half of the people who visit our site see one webpage and the other half see an alternative version so that we can test which version works best.</li>
                    <li>FullStory records pages visited, links clicked, non-sensitive text entered, and mouse movements in a video which we can play back. This is a powerful tool that helps us see the everyday problems people encounter using our site. Your identity cannot be determined from the data collected, we do not create profiles of your behaviour, and we will never sell this data to third parties. Find out more about the <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy/">FullStory cookie.</a></li>
                    <li>Finally, Hotjar shows us the step-by-step path individuals take through our website and lets us know at which points you leave a page. Imagine you click on one of our blog posts and leave before reading to the end – that’s the kind of useful feedback Hotjar gives that helps us figure out what you find interesting and what we need to improve.

                <p>We sometimes connect our site to services like Facebook and Twitter and embed the occasional YouTube video. Like Torchbox, these sites also use cookies, but as you can imagine, we have no control over these third-party cookies.</p>

    <h2 class="streamfield__heading">Why do we use cookies  set by Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn?</h2>
    <div class="streamfield__paragraph">
        <div>
            <div class="rich-text">
                <p>In a nutshell, we use some third-party cookies to check how well our Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn advertising campaigns are doing and improve their relevance to you. They allow us to show you ads if you have visited our site before and then track important behaviours that are valuable to us such as whether you fill in a contact form.</p>
                <p>Here are some links that explain interest-based advertising and how to opt-out:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>Finally, we also use Google Ads. This allows us to show ads that are more relevant to you. We base this on what you are searching for on Google, and webpages that appeared to interest you most when you visited our site in the past. Why? We want you to come back of course.</p>
